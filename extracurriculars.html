                    <h2>Boy Scouts</h2>
                    <p>I've participated in Scouting since the first grade, and I'm currently an Eagle Scout Candidate member of Troop 104. I serve as Junior Assistant Scoutmaster
                        and the Order of the Arrow Representative for my troop.

                    <h2>Track and Field</h2>
                    <p>I run varsity track and field for Wakefield High School. I run the 800m, 4x800m, and 1600m, and I have run at the District, Regional, and State Champsionship for the 4x800m.</p>

                    <h2>Tutoring</h2>
                    <p>I previously served as a member of my school's Learning Leadership Team and helped organize tutoring services for classmates.
                        I currently tutor various math, science, history, and English courses as well as provide ACT and SAT preparation assistance.

        <p style="margin: 5%;">In addition to these three extracurriculars, I also captain my school's calculus olympiad team, serve as Vice President for my school's National Honor Society chapter, volunteer as a senior member of the Community Service Club, and I founded and lead a group for young men of color to explore
            scholarship and educational opportunities at my school. Outside of school, I train in mixed-martial arts, primarily Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and I am a Jack Kent Cooke Young Scholar.

            I'm looking to participate in more STEM-related extracurriculars: programs, internships, research opportunities. If my portfolio impresses you, please feel free to reach out and contact me!
