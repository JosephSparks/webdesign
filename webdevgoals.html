<h1>My Goals for Web Development</h1>
<p>In this Web Design course, I wouldn't say I have super specific goals, like passing a certification
  or finishing a huge project. I guess if I had to pick, my goal would be not relying on HTML libraries
  to make my websites look somewhat passable. I can accomplish this by:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Improve my general knowledge of HTML and CSS. I'm fortunate enough
    to have prior experience, but I hope to be able to build upon it.
  </li>
  <li>Learn useful JavaScript. I know some extremely basic functionalty of JavaScript,
    but it's quite limited. If I can improve on this, as well as the general use of HTML
    and CSS, I can elevate my websites.
  </li>
  <li>Lastly, I hope to get a better eye for design. While my HTMl knowledge is limited,
    I'm also not a very creative person, so if I get the chance to practice designing and learning
    what looks better, I will be able to make my websites look more recent than 2008.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>I'll be updating this list as the year goes on, and hopefully I can cross some of these goals off of my list!</p>
