<h1>About Me: Joseph Sparks</h1>

<p>My name is Joseph Sparks, a junior at the Arlington Career Center, and my main hobbies
studying martial arts, learning Chinese, software design, and all forms of engineering. I'm a big STEM
focused student, and I appreciate the opportunities I receive at ACC that allow me to pursue those interests.
I'm taking Mr. Elkner's Web Design course to further my skills and take an interesting, educational, and entertaining course
that falls within my interests.

I have an older sister, and we share a lot of the same interests. We're both very physically active, as she plays soccer
and I run track for Wakefield High School, and train in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and Muay Thai. I also play basketball recreationally,
and follow professional sports closely. (Go Giants btw)
