                    <p class="me">Hi again! I'm glad you're interested in learning more about me.
                        I come from a low-income family, so my opportunities tend to be limited in regards to extracurriculars, programs, and other resources.
                        As a result, I've worked hard to be able to participate in the programs I have, including the Summer Science Program for astrophysics that I will be attending this summer!

                        Three words I'd use to describe myself are: dependable, resourceful, and enthusiastic. If any of these values are something you'd like to have on your team, please reach out!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I'd appreciate any opportunity to gain experience through an internship or mentorship before university, as I think it'll help me reach new heights for my future!
                    </p>
                    <p>My top schools for application season are:
                        <br>
                        <ol style="color: white;">
                            <li>MIT</li>
                            <li>CalTech</li>
                            <li>Columbia University</li>
                            <li>UPenn</li>

                        </ol>
                        <p style="color: white;">I plan to apply early action to these schools through my QuestBridge scholarship, which I received this spring.</p>
