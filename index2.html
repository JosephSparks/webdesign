        My name is Joseph Sparks, and welcome to my personal website! I made this website to introduce myself, some of my interests,
        and demonstrate some of the things I've been working on.

            About Me:
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am currently a junior at Arlington Tech and take dual-enrolled classes through NOVA for Computer Science. Some of my interests include
            basketball, reading historical non-fiction, singing in a choir, learning Mandarin Chinese, and programming. I am currently on the C.S. Associates pathway
            through NOVA, so I will graduate high school with an Associates degree in Computer Science.

            While computer science is a big passion of mine, I hope to go to university to study aeronautical engineering. I enjoy solving problems, which is definitely part
            of why I love engineering and software design. As aeronautics modernizes more and more, I believe that my software design skills will be able to help me in my career path, as well
            as being constructive hobby.

            My extracurriculars outside of school conist of mixed-martial arts, performing with the National Children's Chorus, Boy Scouts, track and field, National Honor Society volunteering,
            and others. I am also a Jack Kent Cooke Young Scholar and a member of the support group for young men of color at my school.

        <h2>
            My Web Development Goals:
        </h2>
        <ul>
<li>Improve my general knowledge of HTML and CSS. I'm fortunate enough to have prior experience, but I hope to be able to build upon it.</li>
<li>Learn useful JavaScript. I know some extremely basic functionalty of JavaScript, but it's quite limited. If I can improve on this, as well as the general use of HTML and CSS, I can elevate my websites.</li>
<li>Lastly, I hope to get a better eye for design. While my HTMl knowledge is limited, I'm also not a very creative person, so if I get the chance to practice designing and learning what looks better, I will be able to make my websites look more recent than 2008.</li>
