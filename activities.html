        <br>
        <p>Besides school, some of the activities I participate in are Boy Scouts, mixed-martial arts, and I run track for
            Wakefield high school. I am also a member of the National Children's Chorus, and I have the privilege of being a Jack
            Kent Cooke Young Scholar. I enjoy computer sciences, and I hope to be an aerospace engineer after I graduate from university.
